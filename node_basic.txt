Node is a js runtime that use the V8 engine. The V8 engine is a open source js
engine that compile js code into a machine code.

- To run node on the console just type 'node' Ex: node app.js (current directory)
- The equivalent of the window object on node is `global`
- To see and control the current process you just type `process`

Resources
- Build in modules => https://nodejs.org/api/index.html
- nodemon => npm install nodemon -g (dev server)
  To use nodemon just type => nodemon name_of_file.js
  To run a command using nodemon you need to use the --exec flag
  EX: nodemon --exec "npm test"
- When you are passing arguments with the node command you can specify arguments
  but you can't use double quotes on windows when you are using spaces.
  Ex: node app.js remove --tittle="secrets 2"
  You can watch your files using the `e` flag
  Ex: nodemon server.js -e js,hbs
- Debugging => To use the debug mode on the console just need to type the
               following command `node inspect file`.
               Ex: node inspect debugging.js; node inspect app.js --title=title

               To use the chrome inspector to debug a file just need to change.
               To see the file you can go to this url: chrome://inspect/
               the command to `inspect-brk`.
               Ex: node inspect-brk file.js
               List => Command that permit you to see the code lines that you
                       need.
                       Ex: List(10) => Print the 10 first line of the code.
               n(next) => Next line. The line is no execute but its on that line.
               c(continue) => Continue the piece of code until the end.
               repl(read evaluate print loop) => console of the debug.
               debugger => To place a breakpoint on the code; you just need to
                           type debugger.
- Behind the scene on node => Call stack: Simple data structure that keep track
                              of the program execution and statements that are
                              fire inside of V8. Works as a stack putting on the
                              top the last call.
                              Node api: The stack just can do one step at the
                              time.
                              Callback Queue: Where the callbacks that are ready
                              to fire store. Need to wait that the callback
                              stack is empty.
                              Event Loop: Check the call stack is empty and if
                              is empty check the callback queue to see if there
                              something to run and move it to the call stack.
- Callback => Function that is past as an argument to another function that
              execute after some event past.
- Heroku => To deploy a simple app use heroku.
            After you install heroku you need to login your user locally using
            the login command 'heroku login'.
            heroku key:add => Add your local ssh key to heroku.
            heroku key:remove mail => remove the key from heroku.
             ssh -v git@heroku.com => test your connection with heroku.
            heroku create => Create a new app on the heroku web app and create a
            new remote to you github repository.

- Mongo => To run mongo locally; on the bin directory of mongo run the following
           command`mongod.exe --dbpath path_of_data_folder`
           Ex: mongod.exe --dbpath /Users/Hey/Desktop/mongo-data
           To call the mongo console we you just unse the `mongo.exe` command on
           the bin directory.
